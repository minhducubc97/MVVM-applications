# Window applications (MVVM)
Sample Window Applications using MVVM framework:

- CalculatorMiniProject: A simple calculator that can add 2 numbers together. The calculation happens immediately after the user unfocus the textbox.
- DispatcherTimerSample: A simple digital clock that show current time accurate to milliseconds.
- CustomCommand: A simple demonstration of using CommandBinding to: allow shortkey control, enable/disable button, create pop-up window in MVVM.
- TabControl: A simple demonstration of using TabControl in MVVM that features a next button to move to the next tab and a back button to move back to the previous tab. 
- BackgroundWorkerSample: A window with progress bar controlled by BackgroundWorker using multithreading principle. There are three main buttons available to use: Cancel Button - used to close the window, Stop Button - used to stop the BackgroundWorker and the progress bar completely, and Start Button - used to start the BackgroundWorker and trigger the progress bar.

Note: CustomCommand, TabControl and BackgroundWorkerSample use MVVM light framework.

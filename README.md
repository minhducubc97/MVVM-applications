# Window applications (MVVM)
Sample Window Applications using MVVM framework:
1) BASIC:
- CalculatorMiniProject: A simple calculator that can add 2 numbers together. The calculation happens immediately after the user unfocus the textbox.
- DispatcherTimerSample: A simple digital clock that show current time accurate to milliseconds.

</p>
- CustomCommand: A simple demonstration of using CommandBinding to: allow shortkey control, enable/disable button, create pop-up window in MVVM.
- TabControl: A simple demonstration of using TabControl in MVVM that features a next button to move to the next tab and a back button to move back to the previous tab.

</p>
- SoundPlayer: Using built-in SystemSounds libary, the SoundPlayer is capable of playing 5 different sounds: Asterisk, Beep, Exclamation, Hand and Question. The sounds may vary, due to user's customization.
2) ADVANCED:
- BackgroundWorkerSample: A window with progress bar controlled by BackgroundWorker using multithreading principle. There are three main buttons available to use: Cancel Button - used to close the window, Stop Button - used to stop the BackgroundWorker and the progress bar completely, and Start Button - used to start the BackgroundWorker and trigger the progress bar.

- PraceXml: A demonstration of using XmlReader to extract data from Xml file. The information is then displayed on the console. Unlike other projects, this one does not need MVVM.

- ListViewSample: Create a table that resembles an excel sheet, which can receive inputs from the users and calculate the result based on the inputs. In this specific project, the table can calculate gravitation force, given user's input of 2 target objects' mass (m1, m2) and the distance between 2 object (r): F = (G x m1 x m2)/r^2 (Newton). The mini-project feature demonstration of PreviewTextInput, which restricts user to only typing valid characters into the textboxes.

<p><i>Note: Most of the projects use MVVM light framework.</i></p>
